    <p>The Saints community church is a church ministry. Our vision is to train believers in the work of the ministry in
      an atmosphere of love,
      fellowship,
      faith and power. We equip believers with the Word to the intent that the same is grounded and able to teach others
      the same also. </p><a href="https://saintscommunity.net/about-us.html" target="_blank"
